data directory has additional abridged locale data for
the following locales:

   bn,gu,mr,ta,ml,kn,te,or,am,sw,fa

They have the minimal locale data necessary to support them in Chrome 
(Exemplar character set, native display name, writing direction). 

We use them to build the ICU data file for CrOS : icudt46l_dat.S in this
directory. Run 'cp -r data $ICUSRCROOT/source/data' before generating
the ICU data file for CrOS in step 9 of README.chromium.

Chrome/Chromium is localized to those languages, but CrOS is not. To save
space on CrOS, we use the abridged locale files for them instead of the full
locale data.
