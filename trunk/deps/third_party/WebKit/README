This directory is our (mostly) unmodified copy of webkit.

BASE_REVISION: Specifies the webkit branch and revision we are synced to.
MANIFEST: Specifies the list of files that we have forked
fork_files_in_manifest.py: Does the forking magic given the MANIFEST file

To fork/unfork a file:
Changebranch #1
1. Add/remove the file from the MANIFEST
2. Run "../python_24/python.exe fork_files_in_manifest.py MANIFEST"
3. Create a changebranch, send for review and checkin

Changebranch #2
4. Modify trunk/webkit/DEPS to pull in the version of third_party/WebKit that
you just created.
5. gvn cp the files you've forked to pending (or gvn rm them from pending if 
you were unforking)
6. Modify the vcproj files appropriately to point to the files in pending
7. Send the changes out for review and submit.

Changebranch #3
8. Make any changes you wanted to make to the files in pending

TODO(ojan):Make the above involve fewer steps / changebranches and allow
for adding the reasons files are forked directly in the MANIFEST file.
